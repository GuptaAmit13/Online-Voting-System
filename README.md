# Online-Voting-System
Designed and developed a PHP based web application to enable user to vote through an online voting system. Our
system provided a 2-step user authentication process which included a user using their password along with a
randomly generated one-time password which would be sent to userâ€™s registered Mobile or Email id user
password.
